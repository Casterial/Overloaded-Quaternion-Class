# QUATERNION CLASS
This quaternion class may be used by any, I encourage you to even add edits that benefit it.

## Status:
The quaternion class is not yet finished, there are still tweaks here and there needed. As well as certain functions.

## Hardcoded tested variables.
The variables for testing are hardcoded, but you can easily right user input and demonstrate the math. However, if you just want this,
and not a class. Please look at my other Quaternion repo.

## Overloading
Almost everything in this code is overloaded to get the mathematics to work properly. If you need a great example of std::cout being 
overloaded you may use the one provided here, or use it for reference!

### Thanks!
I did this project for fun and was hoping some would use it. It helped me advance my knowledge on quaternions in general.
